## Sea Surface Temperature Forecasting with Ensemble of Stacked Deep Neural Networks
Oceanic temperature has a great impact on global climate and worldwide ecosystems, as its anomalies have been shown to have a direct impact on atmospheric anomalies. The major parameter for measuring the thermal energy of oceans is the Sea Surface Temperature (SST). SST prediction plays an essential role in climatology and ocean-related studies. However, SST prediction is challenging due to the involvement of complex and nonlinear sea thermodynamic factors. To address this challenge,
we design a novel ensemble of two stacked deep neural networks that uses air temperature, in addition to water temperature, to improve the SST prediction accuracy.
To train our model and compare its accuracy with the state-of-the-art, we employ two well-known datasets from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration as well as the international Argo project. Using Deep Neural Networks (DNN), our proposed method is capable of automatically extracting required features from the input timeseries and utilizing them internally to provide a highly accurate SST prediction that outperforms previously published works.
